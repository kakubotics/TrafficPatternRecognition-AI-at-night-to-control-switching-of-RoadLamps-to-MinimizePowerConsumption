# TrafficPatternRecognition-AI-at-night-to-control-switching-of-RoadLamps-to-MinimizePowerConsumption
Collecting videos of traffic at night which is processed using vehicle detection model to obtain relevant traffic frequency dataset which is preprocessed before feeding it into traffic_frequency_prediction model.  this traffic_frequency_prediction model is implemented using tensorflow which is further deployed on raspberry pi with movidius neural compute stick to control street lights in real time.
